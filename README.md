# Pneumonia-Image-Classifier
Convolutional neural network that differentiates pneumonia infected lungs from normal ones.

# X-Ray Pneumonia Detection using Convolutional Neural Network

## Overview

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow to differentiate between X-rays with pneumonia and those without. The model achieved impressive performance metrics:

- Precision: 96.35%
- Recall: 94.51%
- Binary Accuracy: 93.40%

## Dataset

The model was trained on a dataset sourced from Kaggle, which you can find [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia).

## Technologies Used
